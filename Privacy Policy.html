    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: [12-11-2024]</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our Discord bot ("the Bot") collects the following types of information to provide its services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord Usernames and IDs</strong>: Required for identifying users and managing membership.</li>
        <li><strong>Receipts and Membership Proof</strong>: Necessary to verify user eligibility for group access.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone Numbers</strong>: Used to add verified users to a WhatsApp group as part of a membership perk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your data solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify membership status based on receipt validation.</li>
        <li>Manage group access and provide additional membership perks, such as access to exclusive WhatsApp groups.</li>
        <li>Track 30-day membership periods, after which re-verification is required for continued access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to secure your data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Storing verification data in a JSON file (or other secure storage method).</li>
        <li>Limiting access to data only to essential commands and functions within the bot.</li>
        <li>Ensuring no data is shared or sold to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>User data is retained for the duration of active membership. After 30 days without re-verification, data will be transferred to an "expired" status for record-keeping. Users may request deletion of their data by contacting the server administrator.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access the data collected about you.</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of your data.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent for data collection by ceasing use of the Bot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Users will be notified of major changes via a message in the server where the Bot is active.</p>
